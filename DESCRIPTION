Title: Tools to Perform Decompositions of Differences between two
    Groups
Description: Tools to perform decompositions of differences between two groups
    (for example wage decompositions). Focus is on the common support between the distribution
    of the characteristics of the two groups. In the common support, counterfactuals can be
    estimated in order to perform the decomposition.
