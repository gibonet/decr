\title{Performs decomposition of the quantile difference (of y) between two groups (in 2 components) in the common support.}
\usage{
dec_(.dec_, counterfactual = c("AB", "BA"))
}
\arguments{
\item{.dec_}{output of \code{\link{dec_median}} or \code{\link{dec_quantile}}.}

\item{counterfactual}{"AB" or "BA". "AB" means that we want to estimate the counterfactual (wage) of group A, as if their characteristics were distributed as in group B. "BA" is the opposite (characteristics of group B are balanced to those of group A).}
}
\value{
a list with four components:

\itemize{
  \item \code{probs}: the chosen quantile level;
  \item \code{delta_total}: total observed difference between average (wages)
   of group A and B in the common support;
  \item \code{delta_X}: part explained by the fact that the two groups have a
   different distribution of characteristics;
  \item \code{delta_S}: part not justified by the different distributions of the
   characteristics of the two groups, and potentially due to a difference
    in the remuneration structures between the two groups.

\description{
Performs decomposition of the quantile difference (of y) between two groups (in 2 components) in the common support.
